# Nonlinear Analysis to Quantify Movement Variability in Human-Humanoid Interaction
[![slides](/slides/gif-slides/slides.gif)](/slides/slides-03062019.pdf)

# Abstract
Nonlinear analysis can be applied to investigate the dynamics 
of time-ordered data. Such dynamics relate to sensorimotor 
variability in the context of human-humanoid interaction.
Hence, this presentation not only will explore questions such as 
what to quantify in movement variability or which methods of 
nonlinear analysis are appropriate to quantify movement variability 
but also how methods of nonlinear analysis are affected 
by real-world time series data (e.g. non-stationary, data length size, 
sensor sources or noise).
Nonlinear analysis methods are explored to determine 
embedding parameters, reconstructed state spaces, recurrence plots and 
recurrence quantification analysis. 
This work opens new avenues of applications in human-humanoid interaction
where humanoid robots can be programmed with nonlinear analysis algorithms 
to evaluate, for instance, the improvement of movement performances,
to quantify and provide feedback of skill learning
or to quantify movement adaptations and pathologies.
Additionally, work on human-robot interaction and 
the dynamics of face expressions will be presented.

# Biography
Miguel Xochicale completed a four year Ph.D. in Computer Engineering
at University of Birmingham UK in 2018 where his contribution to knowledge 
are in areas of human-humanoid interaction, nonlinear analysis and movement variability.
He published the first open access and 100% reproducible Ph.D. thesis
since the establishment of University of Birmingham in 1901 
available at https://github.com/mxochicale/phd-thesis.
Prior to that, he was a research assistant in robotics 
at the National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics (INAOE), 
Mexico in 2013
and a teaching assistant in Mechatronic Engineering and related subjects
in four universities in Mexico between 2006 to 2012.
He received his M.Sc. degree in Signal Processing from 
INAOE Mexico 2006
and a B.Sc. degree in Electronics from 
Puebla Institute of Technology Mexico 2004.

He is highly motivated with passion for robotics, nonlinear dynamics and 
deep learning, with the ambition to advance AI research and 
to apply such concepts for the benefit of society.
