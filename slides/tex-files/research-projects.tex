%%Entropy measures to quantify regularity and complexity of time series.
%%"Is there a best tool to measure variability?" (Caballero et al. 2014, p. 67)
%
%There is no best tool to measure MV and unification of tools is still
%an open question (Caballero et al. 2014; Wijnants et al. 2009)
%which led me (i) to explore different nonlinear analyses 
%to measure MV and (ii) to understand its strengths and weaknesses.
